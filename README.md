# 🚀 Load & Performance Testing Framework for E-commerce Applications

## 📌 Project Summary

This repository contains a **load and performance testing framework** for e-commerce applications, built using **Python** and **Locust**.

The framework is designed to simulate realistic user traffic, measure backend response times, and identify performance bottlenecks. It supports **configurable load scenarios**, **CSV-driven test data**, and generates **detailed performance reports**.

It follows **industry-standard performance testing practices** and is suitable for both development and production environments.

## 🧰 Technical Skills & Tools

**Languages & Frameworks**

* Python
* Locust (Python load testing tool)

**Performance Testing Concepts**

* Load testing
* Stress testing
* Ramp-up and peak traffic scenarios
* Data-driven test simulations

**Other Tools**

* CSV test data
* Logging & reporting
* Headless execution support

---

## 📂 Test Coverage

This framework covers:

* Multi-stage load patterns
* Simulated user journeys (browse, add to cart, checkout)
* Configurable traffic levels
* Performance metrics collection (response time, failure rates)
* Detailed logging for performance analysis

## ▶️ How to Run the Performance Tests

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IbekweVictor/PERFORMANCE_TEST-FRAMEWORK.git
cd PERFORMANCE_TEST-FRAMEWORK
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run Locust Load Test

```bash
locust
```

### 4️⃣ Access the Locust Web UI

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8089
```

Configure the **host**, **number of users**, and **spawn rate** from the UI or configuration files.

## 📊 Features

* **Custom Load Patterns** – Simulate ramp-up, peak, and ramp-down traffic
* **CSV Data-Driven Tests** – Reuse scenarios and scale tests easily
* **Realistic User Simulation** – Browse, add to cart, checkout workflows
* **Detailed Performance Reporting** – Response times, failure rates, and logs

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Integration

The framework can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines to:

* Automatically run performance tests on build or deployment
* Validate system behavior under load
* Ensure SLA compliance and detect regressions

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters
